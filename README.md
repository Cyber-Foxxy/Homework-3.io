Web page for homework assignment 3
# Week Reflection – Console Log Web Page

## What I created  
For this assignment, I created a simple web page using HTML and an external JavaScript file. The HTML file handles the structure, basic styling, and visible content on the page, including a background color, Comic Sans font, and an image. The JavaScript file contains all the `console.log()` Also listing my favorite websites, games, and artists along with their cultural importance. I also included a question-and-answer with user interaction using `prompt()` and `console.log()`. 

## What generative AI or someone else created  
I also asked generative AI to help generate an example version of this homework. The AI-generated solution was technically correct and followed the instructions, but it was far more generic. While it completed the requirements, it didnt fully reflect my personal interests or the way I would naturally organize and my code unless I edited it.

## How I would feel relying only on AI-generated output or someone else’s work  
If I relied only on AI-generated output or someone else’s work, I would feel less confident in my understanding of the material. While AI can be helpful for guidance or examples, depending on it completely would make it harder for me to learn and improve my coding skills. It would also feel less rewarding because the work would not truly represent my effort.

## Whether I could adequately explain the code that was written  
Yes, I can explain the code that was written. I understand how the HTML and JavaScript files connect, how the `<script>` tag links the external JavaScript file, and how `console.log()` and `prompt()` work. I understand the purpose of comments, styling in the `<style>` tag, and why the script is placed at the end of the HTML document.

## Whether the final work still feels like my own  
The final project still feels like my own work. Even though I used generative AI as a reference and learning tool, I customized the content, structured the code myself, and made sure I understood every part of it. The finished webpage reflects my personal interests and my understanding of the concepts for this assinment.
